# Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics Curriculum

## Welcome to the Future of Robotics Education

This comprehensive curriculum provides hands-on experience with Physical AI and humanoid robotics, covering the complete pipeline from basic ROS 2 fundamentals to advanced Vision-Language-Action (VLA) integration.

## About This Curriculum

The Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics curriculum is designed for:
- Students learning Physical AI and humanoid robotics
- Robotics enthusiasts with Python and ROS 2 experience
- Learners preparing for simulation and real-world humanoid deployment

## Curriculum Structure

The curriculum is organized into four interconnected modules:

### Module 1: The Robotic Nervous System (ROS 2)
Learn the fundamentals of ROS 2 for humanoid robot control, including nodes, topics, services, actions, and URDF modeling.

### Module 2: The Digital Twin (Gazebo & Unity)
Experience physics simulation with digital twins, integrating humanoid models into realistic environments with accurate sensor simulation.

### Module 3: The AI-Robot Brain (NVIDIA Isaac)
Implement advanced perception and navigation systems using NVIDIA Isaac, including VSLAM and Nav2 path planning.

### Module 4: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) Integration
Integrate AI for autonomous task execution, creating voice-to-action pipelines with cognitive planning and object recognition.

## Learning Outcomes

By completing this curriculum, you will be able to:
- Design and implement ROS 2 systems for humanoid robot control
- Create and validate simulation environments with realistic physics
- Build AI perception and navigation systems for autonomous operation
- Integrate voice commands with robotic action execution
- Complete a capstone project demonstrating all concepts

## Prerequisites

- Basic Python programming knowledge
- Understanding of fundamental robotics concepts
- Access to a Linux environment (Ubuntu 22.04 LTS recommended)
- RTX 4070 Ti+ GPU for NVIDIA Isaac Sim (optional but recommended)

## Getting Started
